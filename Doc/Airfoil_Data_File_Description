Airfoil data tables contain the coefficient data and dynamic stall parameters for an airfoil across the Reynolds number range
to be used in the calculation. The airfoil coefficients are input as lift, drag, and pitching moment (about the 25% chord point).
A maximum of 20 Reynolds number values are allowed. A maximum of 1000 angle of attack values for each Reynolds number are allowed. 
AOA data must go from -180 to 180 deg. The sign convention for AOA is such that positive AOA on a blade element is generated by 
positive relative flow velocity in the positive element normal direction. Note that the cross-flow turbine geometry generator in 
CACTUS creates element normal vectors in the machine inward direction. The axial flow turbine geometry generator creates element 
planform normal vectors in the machine rearward (downwind) direction. The "Reverse Camber Direction" flag allows the user to 
reverse the orientation of a non-symmetric airfoil with respect to the normal vector of the blade element to which it is applied 
(set the flag to 1).

Dynamic stall parameters:
BV Dyn. Stall Model:
	The Boeing-Vertol dynamic stall model uses reference angle of attack values to switch from a steady attached flow state to a 
	dynamic stalled state. While these are denoted as "stall" AOA values, they should be set back from the airfoil stall AOA such
	that the lift coefficient is still fairly linear with AOA at this point. Generally, a value 50 - 75% of the way between the 
	zero lift AOA and the stall AOA works well.
LB Dyn. Stall Model:
	The Leishman-Beddoes dynamic stall model uses a reference lift slope and a critical lift coefficient value to indicate the 
	onset of leading edge stall. The critical lift coefficient value should be approximately equal to the value of lift 
	coefficient that would have been obtained at the airfoil stall AOA, had the lift coefficient remained linear with AOA (with
	slope given by the reference lift coefficient slope).
