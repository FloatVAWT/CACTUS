\section{OpenMP acceleration}
OpenMP acceleration is enabled in the main Biot-Savart calculation loop as well as in the calculation of field velocities as described in 5.5. OpenMP is enabled by default, provided the appropriate flags are selected during compilation and that the OpenMP libraries are properly linked.

If OpenMP is enabled, CACTUS will write to standard out a few lines stating so. If CACTUS has not been compiled correctly with OpenMP flags and libraries, or if OpenMP is otherwise disabled, those lines about OpenMP will be omitted.

If the number of threads displayed is less than the number of cores/threads available on the machine, check that the environment variable \texttt{OMP\_NUM\_THREADS} is correctly set.
