Configuration Inputs (&ConfigInputs namelist):

Regression Testing:
RegTFlag: (int) Set to 1 to perform a regression test (two iterations, generates RegData.out output file), 0 for normal operation (default)

Wall calculation:
GPFlag: (int) Set to 1 to use a ground plane, 0 otherwise
FSFlag: (int) Set to 1 to use a free surface, 0 otherwise
GPGridSF: (real) factor on default ground plane grid spacing
FSGridSF: (real) factor on default free surface near-field grid spacing

Calculation inputs:
nr: (int) Number of revolutions to perform (default: 10).
nti: (int) Number of time steps per revolution (default: 16). 
convrg: (real) Convergence level for the revolution average power coeff. (default: no convergence check). Iteration will finish before nr revs if this level is hit.
iut: (int) Number of iterations between wake convection velocity updates. If set to zero, the interval will be calculated automatically. If negative, wake convection velocities will be left at the values calculated at the time the wake element is created (no wake convection velocity updates).
iWall: (int) Number of iterations between wall model updates (if wall calculation is active).
ivtxcor: (int) 0 to use finite vortex core with width equal to reference blade chord (default), 1 to not use core model

Wake convection speedup options:
ifc: (int) 1 to use final convergence step, 0 to not (default). The discretization level is refined once/if initial convergence is reached before nr revolutions have been performed.
nric: (int) Revolution number after which to switch to final convergence, if initial convergence level has not yet been achieved (optional). 		
ntif: (int) Final number of time steps per revolution. This value will replace nti during final convergence.
convrgf: (real) Final convergence level (default: .0001). This level will replace convrg during final convergence.
iutf: (int) Final number of iterations between wake updates. This value will replace iut during final convergence. Default behavior is the same as iut.
ixterm: (int) 1 to ignore wake points beyond x/R = xstop (where R is the reference radius given in the geometry input file), 0 to use all wake points (default).  	
xstop: (real) If ixterm = 1, defines x/R beyond which wake points are ignored (default: 5).

PRFlag: (int) 0 for no pitch rate aero effects, 1 to include these effects (default)

Optional outputs:
Output_ELFlag: (int) 1 to output full detail element loads .csv file, 0 to omit this output (default)
WallOutFlag: (int) 1 to output wall panel data (averaged over the last revolution), 0 to omit this output (default).
DiagOutFlag: (int) 1 to output diagnostic info to stdout each iteration, 0 to omit this output (default)
