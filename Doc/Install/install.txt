Installation of CACTUS for Linux or Mac machines.
================================================================================
1. Uncompress the directory and put in desired location. On terminal cd into the 
   correct directory (you should be able to see the makefiles).

2. Create the executable by typing the following on the terminal.
   	For pgf95 compiler type:        $ make 
   	For gfortran compiler type:     $ make -f Makefile.gfortran
   	For ifort compiler type:        $ make -f Makefile.ifort

  The executable will be called 'cactus' and be located in the 'bin' directory.

  Alternative makefiles must be used to enable OpenMP acceleration.
    For gfortran with OpenMP type:  $ make -f Makefile.gfortran.omp

  OpenMP makefiles for other compilers have not yet been written,
  but it should be easy to create them by adding the appropriate compiler flags.

3. Add the executable's location to your path so that you can call it by simply
   typing 'cactus' on the terminal instead of the complete path. In Linux this
   is generally done in the ~/.bashrc file. 

4. cd into the Test/RegTest directory
     	$ cd ./Test/RegTest
   and run the RegTest by executing runreg.py with the path to the CACTUS 
   executable as an argument (or just the name of the executable if you added it 
   to your path).
     	$ python ./runreg.py ../../../cactus
   or
     	$ python ./runreg.py cactus
   The output should say 'No differences' for all three tests.
   NOTE: You will need Python installed to run the regTest

CONGRATULATIONS! You have successfully installed CACTUS. :)
